        <p> With his boxing license stripped away for nearly a year due to hand wrap issues 
        </p>
        <p>    
            in his previous fights, Margarito is seeking to beat number one contender, Manny  
        </p> 
            <p>
            Pacquiao in the junior welterweight division. Robert Garcia explains that Margarito 
        </p>
            <p>
           is the biggest opponent that Pacquiao has fought and that the mexican warrior must 
        </p>
            <p>
            put his weight advantage to good use and bully the Filipino boxer. Margarito trained
        </p>
            <p>
            by learning how to crowd and push his opponents against the ropes to land heavy 
        </p>
            <p>
            power shots which is exactly what he would do against Pacquiao. Reyhdration is also 
        </p>
            <p>
            key to winning this fight as Margarito's nutrition will be tested on how he will
        </p>
            <p>
    gain back the essential water weight to add extra pounds after the weigh-in.

        </p>
            <p>
            for a fight with natural middle-weight Antonio Margarito. The training camp knows

    <p>
            and understands that Margarito is a lot bigger than the Filipino boxer and that

            he will have to be a perfect fighter that night. This is where Alex Ariza, Pacquao's
