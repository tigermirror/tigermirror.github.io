        <p>Erik Morales, the pound for pound king at the time of this fight, was about to face 
        </p>
            <p>
            manny pacquiao for a rematch. Even though he won the first fight, he has not faced a 
        </p>
            <p>
            fighter like Pacquiao ever before as his speed and power proved to be a difficult 
        </p>
            <p>
            puzzle for the technical mexican champ. This is one of the reasons why the Morales

            <p>
            training camp had hired a new sparring partner by the name of Edwin Valero, a 
        </p>
            <p>
            fighter to this day, has many critics agreeing that he is one of the fighters that 
        </p>
            <p>
            closely resemble the Filipino boxer's style, using angles and speed and throwing 
        </p>
    <p>
            with real power.</p>

    <br> 
        <p>In this rematch with the Mexican champion, Pacquiao changed his training routine and 
</p>
<p>            
            improved on his explosiveness and speed as head coach Freddie Roach claimed that 
</p>         
    <p>        
            this would be the key to victory for the Filipino. Even though there was a headbutt

    <p>        
            in the first fight which contributed to Pacquiao's performance, strength and

            conditioning coach Justin Fortune explained that they should be ready for all

            possible situations and has made a rigorous and demanding workout routine for Manny 
</p>
