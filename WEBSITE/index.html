        <h3>#5: MANNY PACQUIAO VS ERIK MORALES 2 </h3>

      <p> 
    After losing to Erik Morales in their first confrontation on March 19 2005, Pacquiao knew that if he was to beat the greatest fighter in all pound for pound lists at that time for a rematch, he had to evolve. This fight is part of the top 5 greatest Pacquiao fights list because it marked and sealed the beginning of a new Manny Pacquiao. From being a one dimensional, 1-2 fighter, Pacquiao had learned from his mistake in the previous fight with morales to become a more versatile and explosive fighter that could use more angles and could throw power punches for the whole duration of a fight while still paying attention to his positioning and defense. As Manny faced Morales the second time, his rigorous training camp with strength and conditioning coach Justin Fortune accompanied with the new techniques honed by head coach Freddie Roach and assistant coach Buboy Fernandez payed off as he dominated the fight from the get-go. Manny was able to stop Erik in the 10th round via TKO victory. This is #5 because it marked the start of Pacquiao's physical and technical peak.

        After the shocking and controversial loss to Australian Jeff "The Hornet" Horn in Brisbane a year ago, Manny Pacquiao had experienced the longest lay-off of his entire career. Deep inside, boxing fans all over the world had anticipated the Filipino Champ to hang his gloves and focus on being a senator in the Philippines where he resides, never to step into a ring again. His loss to Horn last year is what you would get if you combine age effects on boxing performance, bad referee work, and a biased Australian judge all rolled into one knuckle sandwich. On top of that, Manny Pacquiao's long time head coach Freddie Roach was fired as Golden Boy and MP promotions were making negotiations for a comeback fight for Pacquiao in Malaysia. As an all-Pinoy team(except for Justin Fortune) with new head coach Buboy Fernandez, and assistant coach Nonito Donaire Sr., the training camp that Manny was in felt like a fresh start that began way too late. Many critics suggested an early night for Matthysse as people had no idea how an old boxer like Manny could stand up to a knockout artist like the Argentinian champ. However, the critics were proven wrong when Pacquiao was able to dominate the entire fight, knocking down Matthysse three times in the duration of 7 rounds and ending the night early with a sensational TKO victory in the 7th round, Pacquiao's first knockout in almost a decade after the fight with Cotto in 2009. This is #4 because it is Pacquiao's most memorable comback to date.

        <h3> #3: Manny Pacquiao vs Miguel Cotto</h3>

        <p>
        The fight with Miguel Cotto happened during a time which can be regarded as Pacquiao's golden years. After successfully putting down Ricky Hatton, Boxing critics had claimed that Manny could not standup against anyone in the welterweight division, especially someone like Miguel Cotto that was a natural welterweight and had knockout power in both hands. When the training camp for this fight had begun, the Philippines had just recovered from super-typhoon, Ondoy, and Pacquiao did not seem to have the same hunger and passion as he always did as his attention was diverted to this natural calamity. The streets of Baguio were flooded and Manny did not have a place to do his road work. With new strength and conditioning coach, Alex Ariza, more inovative ways to train were added to Pacquiao's arsenal such as plyometrics and pool work instead of road work. As Pacquiao was going up in weight again, their training camp knew that Cotto was a name that spelled doom for the filipino champ if he could not take the puerto rican's power shots. However, the camp succeeded as Pacquiao was able to take some and defintely give some. The puerto rican had a rough night as he could not keep up with Pacquiao's speed, power and stamina which combined, resulted in an 11th round TKO victory for the filipino champ accompanied with an early 3rd round knockdown scored by the Filipino champ. This is #3 because it was Pacquiao's most complete fight.

        <h3> #2: Manny Pacquiao vs Ricky Hatton</h3>

        <p>
        The fight that all boxing fans will think of and refer to as the ultimate knockout fight of the filipino champ is his fight with Ricky Hatton in 2008. It is the fight that will be remembered when the long career of Manny Pacquiao is over and will be the fight that will be told in legend and song. Ricky "The Hitman" Hatton is one of Manny's most impressive opponents in terms of records as his only loss was to the undefeated champion Floyd Mayweather. In anticipation to this fight, people knew that Hatton was a body puncher and knockout artist that likes to hurt his opponents and take them to deep waters. Just for this fight, the Hatton training camp hired Floyd "Joy" Mayweather Sr., Mayweather's father, as head coach. This showcased Hatton's desire to win because he went so far as to make his conqueror's coach his own, which, in his mind would spell victory. However, the pacquiao in this fight was the hungry and explosive warrior who had just beaten Oscar De la Hoya. Pacquiao was in his physical peak and would knockout any man who stood before him in a ring. This statement describes the entire fight as boxing fans from Britain and the Philippines were sent home early due to a KO victory by Pacquiao in the 2nd round right after flooring Hatton in the first. This is #2 because it includes Pacquiao's most iconic knockout.

        <h3> #1: Manny Pacquiao vs. Antonio Margarito</h3>

        <p>
        When we hear the name Manny Pacquiao, we think of a man that can change his physical properties, move up and down in weight to fight taller, stronger, and more massive fighters, and still retain the same speed and power. The fight that characterizes this trait of the filipino champ is shown in his fight with the unnaturally large junior middle-weight, Antonio Margarito. This fight, by far, when compared and analyzed carefully is Manny's most impressive victory to date. Margarito, standing at 5'11 is towering over the smaller Pacquiao, standing at only 5'5. On the way to the fight, Margarito weighed a shocking 11 stone 11, which is in middle weight domains already. Even though this was a junior middleweight fight, Pacquiao went against a true born middleweight that had power in both hands and combined with a huge weight advantage and a devastating mexican style. This fight was proof that someone doesnt need to be bigger to win fights and that speed, explosiveness, coordination, and footwork are the keys to victory. Pacquiao dominated the entire fight, rearranging the mexican champion's face and even looked to the referee to stop the fight as he felt like his opponent had enough punishment for one night. This is #1 because it is relatively the most impressive Victory of Pac's entire career.
