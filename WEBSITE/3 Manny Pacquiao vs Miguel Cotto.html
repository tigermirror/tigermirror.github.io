        <p>Having fought in the welterweight devision for the majority of his career, Miguel 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Cotto felt right at home preparing for his title defense with the rising Filipino 
        </p> 
            <p>
            star, Manny Pacquiao. For this training camp, Cotto trainied in the country in 
        </p>
            <p>
            Puerto Rico where he felt very much at home. In this training camp, they were 
        </p>
            <p>
            confident of Cotto's power and that if they could land power shots, Pacuiao wouldn't
        </p>
            <p>
            be able to take it. Cotto claimed that he had faced opponents much bigger and had 
        </p>
            <p>
            more power than the Filipino and that he was able to put a stop to those opponents. 
        </p>
            <p>
            In sparring, Cotto faced opponents of the similar weight that had the same southpaw 
        </p>
            <p>
            stance as Manny to prepare him for their confrontation.</p>

            <p>
            that Manny must not get cornered on the ropes to prevent the slower and bulkier
