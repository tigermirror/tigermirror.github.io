        <p>Lucas Matthysse is a knockout artist. His record of 36 wins and 32 wins by knockout 
    </p>   
        <p>    
            says it all. For this training camp, Joel Diaz, the head coach of the camp said that 
    </p> 
        <p>    
            they have to find a way to land Matthysse's money shot, his right hand, if they were 
    </p> 
        <p>    
            to end the night early with a knockout. Ryan Garcia, Matthysse's stablemate can 
    </p> 
        <p>    
            testify for the Argentinian puncher's power as he says that when Lucas "smells 
    </p> 
        <p>    
            blood", he goes on a frenzy. Matthysse is focusing on honing his powerful straight 
    </p> 
        <p>    
            right as well as his coordination.</p>

        <p><em>The fighting senator, Manny pacquiao(right) hitts the mitts with head coach, Buboy Fernandez(left).</em></p>
<br> 
        <p>Coming from the longest lay off from his entire career, Pacquiao will have to train 
</p>   
    <p>        
            differently for this fight. Strength and conditioning coach, Justin Fortune amd Head 
</p>     
    <p>        
            coach, Buboy Fernandez have claimed to be preparing the fighting senator with short 
</p>     
    <p>        
            intervals instead of the long aerobic training sessions they were doing when 
</p>     
    <p>        
            Pacquiao was younger. Pacquiao also has the tendency to overtrain and at his age he 
</p>     
    <p>        
            needs to watch out because he still needs to peak at the right time and that the 
</p>     
    <p>        
            moment the bell rings to signal the start of the first round. In the Pacquiao 
</p>     
    <p>        
            training camp, they hired George Kambosos Jr. to be Pacquiao's main sparring 
</p>     
    <p>        
            partner. Kambosos is an undefeated boxer with speed and power just like Manny. Buboy 
</p>     
    <p>        
            claimed that Pacquiao was able to knockdown Kambosos in sparring which speaks of 
</p>     
    <p>        
            their success in training.</p>
