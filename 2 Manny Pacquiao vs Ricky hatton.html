        <p> Coming from a loss from Floyd "Money" Mayweather, at this point in his career, Ricky 
        </p>
        <p>    
            "The Hitman" Hatton is looking for a big comeback fight. Hiring his conqueror's  
        </p> 
            <p>
            father and trainer, the new duo sought to beat the pound for pound best boxer in the 
        </p>
            <p>
           world at this time: Manny Pacquiao. Just like the Filipino, Hatton is an offensive 
        </p>
            <p>
            boxer that puts emphasis on body punching to knock out his opponents and make them
        </p>
            <p>
            quit. His entire career is full of these kinds of knockouts and this is what Ricky 
        </p>
            <p>
            trained to deliver against Manny Pacquiao. Mayweather Sr. also added more defense 
        </p>
            <p>
            to Ricky's offensive arsenal, emphasizing the danger in Pacquiao's left hand.
        </p>
            <p>
    Mayweather Sr. Seeks to do this with the aid of his "Philly" shell defensive techniques.

        <p>
            Coming from a devastating TKO victory from Oscar De la Hoya, Pacquiao is now set to 
        </p>
            <p>
            train against Ricky "The Hitman" Hatton in this light-welterweight title fight. 
        </p>
    <p>
            To arm Manny for this fight, Freddie roach came up with a brilliant new technique 
        </p>     
            <p>
            that he called "The Manila Ice" a short, timed right hook which can vary in power
        </p>
            <p>
            depending on how it is thrown. This right hook is made to create an opening for 
        </p>
            <p>
            the filipino's left hand which is his power shot. In training camp, speed and 
        </p>
            <p>
            timing are the keys to victory for Pacquiao.</p>
